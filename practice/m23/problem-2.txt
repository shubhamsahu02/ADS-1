Keys:A B C D E F G
Hash:2 0 0 4 4 4 1

For the given problem set :

a. E F G A C B D -- it couldn't form as it does not follow given hash and keys order as per question
b. C E B G F D A -- it couldn't form as it does not follow given hash and keys order as per question
c. B D F A C E G -- it couldn't form as it does not follow given hash and keys order as per question
d. C G B A D E F -- it forms as per question and the new order is D E F C G B A
e. F G B D A C E -- it couldn't form as it does not follow given hash and keys order as per question
f. G E C A D B F -- it couldn't form as it does not follow given hash and keys order as per question
